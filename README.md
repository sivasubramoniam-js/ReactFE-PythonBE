# Youtube Assistant

Welcome to the **Youtube Assistant**! This project combines a **React frontend** with a **Python backend** to create a seamless web application experience. 

In this application, you can perform various tasks on YouTube videos:

- **Search for YouTube videos** in the left sidebar.
- **Watch videos** using the play option.
- **Add videos to your list** for later use.
- Once a video is added to the list, you can choose between different options:
  - **Chat with video**: Engage in a chat to summarize or analyze the video.
  - **Jump to specific content**: Skip directly to the parts of the video you care about.
  - **Pick the right one**: Choose the best video from available options to save time.
